PICInjDriver: designed and written by Sean Stasiak in a fit of rage after
discovering his pile of junk experimental/unknown injectors kept getting
larger.

What does this project do ? It's a dead simple way of getting an unknown
injector characterized to a pretty high degree (if you're methodical enough).
You may need to do your own research on how it's done, I really don't have
the bandwidth to walk you through it, but feel free to email anyways.
